Digital Audio Launchpad is a generative music tool, aimed to produce beats, loops, and aural
drones based upon data mined from the Twitter stream.  The application will gather keywords
from the user, use these keywords to filter the Twitter stream of incomming 
tweets.  Once these tweets are filtered accordingly the string information will then be used 
as the basis for the data in which the application's alogrithms construct its 
finished product.  

The generated pieces of music, will be exprotable as a midi file, so that if they are to 
be found interesting by the user they can then export the file and be able to use it in 
any midi compatible (which only very few things are not midi compatible) piece of software or 
hardware.  

The User will be able to search for new keywords at any time, and be able to store keywords 
if they have found that the generative results from particular searches have been interesting
to them.  The user will also have a storage locker of beats, loops, or drones, this storage locker can 
be used to save the tagged material that the user has generated.

The aim of the application is to serve as a spring board for musicians whom have hit creative 
writers block.
