# Milestones


### Milestone 1 
a very basic milestone, at this point the application only really had the docs folder with initial wireframes, an ERD, a README file, and only 
one activity that would demostrate the type of application navigation I was planning to use for the application 

### Milestone 2 

Now we have some more going on with the application itself, it currently has the databasing structure implemented and there is databasing activity 
that is being demonstrated on the landing fragment of the application.  The landing fragment is the "keyword" fragment, this is where the user will
be able to input up to two words either through the text edit tool, or through the list of databased keywords that the user has previously input.
the "Live in the Past" button will display the list once clicked, if clicked again it will hide the list.  The add word button will add the typed in word 
into the database, and it will also populate into a text view below to signifiy that it will be a word to be used in the generation of the haiku 
they user can input zero, one, or two words.  The Build Haiku button will bring the user to the haiku fragment where the hiaku and music generation 
will take place, this is also the plan for the All Random button (though not yet imlpemented). I plan to change the list view into a recycler view as well.

Over all there is user interaction with being able to input data, and the input from the user is persistant and can be accessed.
